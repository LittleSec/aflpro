Michal Zalewski
    - Made the original suggestion of sending afl-fuzz test cases back through
      a project with gcov profiling support built-in.

Markus Teufelberger
    - Submitted a patch to add --cover-corpus argument so that code coverage
      is measured only after all new AFL test cases are executed. The main
      advantage is that code coverage results are produced more quickly in
      this mode since AFL can generate test cases - at least initially - much
      faster than code coverage can be calculated for each test case.
